# Transportation-network-project
### Description
An alone project for an algorithm course from Polytech Annecy-Chambery

with data from bus line 1 and 2 of the SIBRA transportation network we find 
the FASTEST and the SHORTEST path to go from a bus stop to another with Dijkstra's algorithm
      
In data files we have all the schedule of every bus stop but because of a lack of time 
the project is just able for now to find the fastest and shortest between 2 bu stop without specifying the departure time
it may be available in an update or feel free to develop it by yourself !
the Graph class and Dijkstra's algorithm isn't from me(go to Thanks to look who did it). 
I have modified some details but it is pretty close from the original.
   
   
### How to make it work
1-download all the files and put it in the same folder

2-change the path of your folder in Exploitation_Fichier.py

3-run every class file

4-run Exploitation_fichier.py

5-run Main.py
